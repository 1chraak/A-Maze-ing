# A-Maze-ing

## Description

A-Maze-ing is a maze generation and visualization tool written in Python 3.
The program generates a random maze based on a configuration file, calculates the shortest path between entry and exit points, and provides an interactive terminal interface.

The maze can be configured as:

- **Perfect**: Exactly one unique path between the entry and the exit.
- **Imperfect**: Contains cycles and multiple paths while remaining fully connected.

The project strictly follows the mandatory requirements defined in the subject, including structural constraints and output formatting.

# Features

- Random maze generation using Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Support for both Perfect and Imperfect maze types
- Shortest pathfinding algorithm implementation
- Hexadecimal file output for maze architecture
- Interactive ASCII visualization in the terminal
- Real-time step-by-step path animation
- Multiple color themes for terminal rendering
- Input validation for configuration files

# How to Run

To run the program, use the following command with a valid configuration file:

python3 a_maze_ing.py config.txt

## Interactive Controls

Once the maze is displayed, you can use these keys:

- **p** : Toggle the shortest path (Show/Hide)
- **a** : Start the pathfinding animation
- **c** : Cycle through available color themes
- **q** : Quit the program
